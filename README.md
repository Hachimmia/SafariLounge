# TheSafariLounge

The Safari Lounge is the graded unit project for my course in HND web development year 1, which finished in 2022.

The project was about a refurnishing of a website that already excist, and make it as a new one. I chose an Edinburgh pub called The Safari Lounge for this.

This is a solo project, so I made the logo, the design and the code part. I also went on loco to take photos of the place.

For building thi project I used:

- HTML
- SASS
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- AOS
- npm

Software:
- Visual Studio Code
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
